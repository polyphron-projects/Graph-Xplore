## Instructions

### Overview



### User Input

The main page can be used to enter the comma-separated-value list of accounts that are both follwers of, and following, a given sample account. The Graph that they belong to should also be specified, so that you can have multiple graph sets (e.g., different groups of users). Simply click  "Add Account" when done, and the account details will be added to the graph.
